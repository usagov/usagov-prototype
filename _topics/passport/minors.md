## Apply for or renew a passport for a minor under 18

Children must apply for or renew a passport in person at a passport acceptance facility. The cost will vary depending on the child’s age and if you are applying for the first time or renewing a passport. The standard processing time is 6-8 weeks. 

## Children under 16
A parent must be present and co-sign the passport application for children under 16.

Follow the [step-by-step process from the State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/apply-renew-passport/under-16.html) to ensure you have the proper forms and determine how much the passport will cost. For children getting a passport book, there are two fees totaling $115.

## Children ages 16-17
Children ages 16-17 can apply for their own passport if they have their identification documents. A parent will need to provide a signed statement saying they are aware the child is seeking a passport or attend the passport appointment with them.

Follow the [step-by-step process from the State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/apply-renew-passport/16-17.html) to ensure you have the proper forms and determine how much the passport will cost. For a passport book, there are two fees totaling $145. 

## Children in custody disputes
If you are concerned your child may be taken abroad by another legal guardian without your knowledge, you can enroll them in the [Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program (CPIAP)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/legal-matters/custody.html).
