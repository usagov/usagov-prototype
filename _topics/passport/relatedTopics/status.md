## Apply for a new adult passport

In many cases, you need a passport to travel outside of the United States. You have to apply in-person. A new passport book has two fees totaling $145 and the standard processing times is 6-8 weeks.

## Eligibility

To have a U.S. passport, you must be a U.S. citizen by birth or naturalization or be a qualifying U.S. national

## Items you need to apply for a passport

* Application -- You will need form DS-11. You can fill it out online or download it and fill it out by hand. Do not sign the form until you are at your appointment and the passport acceptance official tells you to do so. 
* Personal documents including:
  * Original proof of citizenship
  * An acceptable photo ID
  * A photocopy of both your citizenship document and photo ID
* Passport photo 
* Payment

Apply at a local passport acceptance facility. This could be a library or post office. Some facilities require appointments or have limited hours.
