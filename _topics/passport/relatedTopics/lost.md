## Lost or Stolen Passports
If your passport is lost or stolen you must report it to the State Department right away. 

### How to report your lost or stolen passport
* Online: [use the wizard to submit form DS-64 online](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/lost-stolen.html)
* By phone: call toll free at 1-877-487-2778 (TTY 1-888-874-7793)
* By mail: use [form DS-64](https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds64.pdf) (PDF, [Download Adobe Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/)) and mail it to the address on the form

Once you have reported your passport lost or stolen, it is invalidated by the State Department. It cannot be used if it is found.

### How to replace your lost or stolen passport
If you’re in the United States and your passport is lost or stolen, you must use form DS-11 to apply for a new passport in person. Follow [the guidance from the State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/after/lost-stolen.html), which is based on how quickly you need your new passport. 

If you’re outside the United States, contact your nearest [U.S. Embassy or consulate](http://www.usembassy.gov/) to replace your lost or stolen passport.

### What to do if you find someone else’s lost passport
If you find a U.S. Passport in the United States, mail the passport to:

    U.S. Department of State
    Consular Lost and Stolen Passport Unit
    Attn: (CLASP)
    CA/PPT/S/L/LE
    4TH FLOOR
    1150 Passport Services Place
    Dulles, VA 20189-1150

If you find a U.S. passport while abroad, return the passport to the nearest [U.S. Embassy or consulate](http://www.usembassy.gov/).

If you find a foreign passport in the U.S., return the passport to the [issuing country's embassy or consulate](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html).
